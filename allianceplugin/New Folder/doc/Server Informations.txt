Alliance Plugin
Server Informations
Version 1.0
Author Thoralf Rickert


This plugin uses a server side script to manage the report and orders.
At the moment there is no public server that you can use to manage your
alliance. You have to install your own server. This document shows you,
what you need.

First, of course, you need a server that is always connected to the
internet and that can be reached from the internet. So you have to
check that another can connect to it over the internet.

Second, you need to install some software. At the moment there are
to ways to use the software. At the beginning of the development
the server side script is a PHP script that waits for report and
order requests. It communications in the backend with a java program
that merges the reports and the commands. So you server needs a 
PHP enabled HTTP server (Apache) that can start local script. And you
need Java on the server that you can start from PHP (so PHP must be
enabled to execute a shell command). Attention: Most public servers 
don't provide this service - so check that. Another way is the 
"future" solution that needs a Tomcat server. Some informations from
the user, the orders etc. are stored in MySQL database. That should
not be a problem. Most servers have MySQL instance installed.
