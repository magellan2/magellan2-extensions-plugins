# Alliance Plugin

Welcome to the Alliance Plugin for Magellan2. This plugin makes it 
possible, that multiple factions can use on single report to manage 
commands ignoring any faction limits. So you can allow that one 
person manages one region or island alone and gives all commands 
for all allied factions in this region or island. The others merges
your given commands to their own and send it to the Eressea server.

Attention: This plugin is a little bit in the grey zone of the 
rules of Eressea. Normally a person should only make commands for 
his/her own faction. The commands for every other faction in the 
alliance should be communicated via voice or mail. This plugin 
shorten this process 'a little bit'.

And this plugin is only really useful if you share your whole report
with all other factions in the alliance. So, everybody sees 
everything. At the moment it is not possible to create a permission
level for single factions. This feature is planned but it's not easy
to develop. Only think about all the possible right levels for a
single faction, island, region, unit. And you should be aware that
all data from all reports uploaded to the server can be read by the
owner of the server.
