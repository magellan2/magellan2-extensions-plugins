The ShipLoader plugin works as follows:

-- select units in the overview
-- right-click on a unit, select ShipLoader-add units to include units
-- select and add ships in the same way
-- choose Plugins--ShipLoader--Load! This will try to load the units onto the ships as best as 
   possible.

Plugins--ShipLoader--Show all units and ships: Displays a list of added ships and units
Plugins--ShipLoader--Reset all units and ships: Removes all ships and units from the list
Plugins--ShipLoader--Remove all unit orders of ShipLoader: Removes from the selected units all 
   orders added by shiploader (which are marked by a special marker comment).
